<h1 align="center">Welcome to Simple Bank ðŸ‘‹</h1>

> ðŸ˜‹  This repository hosts my Backend Project for A Simple Bank, a Golang-based web service to create and manage money transfers between available accounts.  ðŸ˜‹

## About
Through this project, I've developed a robust backend system for a banking application. 

Key features include account management, transaction records, and inter-account money transfers. 

The project spans several critical areas of backend development, including database design with DBML, transaction handling, API development using the Gin framework, user authentication with JWT and PASETO, and implementing robust testing strategies. Additionally, the repository demonstrates proficiency in deploying applications using Docker and Kubernetes on AWS, complete with domain registration and traffic routing. 

In this project, I've delved deeply into backend web service development, showcasing my practical abilities and grasp of key tools and technologies. I want to use this project as a platform to demonstrate my dedication and eager to learn backend development and my ability to contribute meaningfully in a professional context.
